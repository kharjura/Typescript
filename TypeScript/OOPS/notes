OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING IN TYPESCRIPT:
IN TYPESCRIPT we can handle the following phenomenons
1)Inheritance:
  * The phenomenon of the childclass acquiring the properties ofsuper class is called Inheritance.
  * The constructors cannot be inheritance,they can only be invoke using superkeyword.
2)Polymorphism:
 * The phenomenon where one object behaves in multiple manners is called polymorphism
    ex:one single person behaves as one Employee at a company,has a passenger in a bus
* There are two types of polymorphism
a)Compiletime polymorphism(static polymorphism):-
 * The binding between object & the function happens during compile time
 * It is shown by function overloading
 * function overloading means multiple functions having the same name but different types of parameters.
b) Run time polymorphism(dynamic polymorphism):-
 * The binding between object and the function happens during run time.
 * It shown by function overriding.
 * function overriding means changing the implimentation of superclass function by the child class function. TO make this happen the superclass and child class must have the function with 
 the same function name & parameter but different implimentation  
 3) Abstruction:
 It is the process of hiding the implimentation of and providing only the functionality of an object.
 4) Encaspulation:
  It is brought about by resricting direct acess to the attributes using private keyword and providing 
  indirect acess using setter & getter function
  read + write => get()+set()
  read ->get()
  write ->set()
  Abstraction:
  * It is the process of hiding the implementation and providing only the functionality.
  * It is implemented by making the class Abstruct keyword.
  * Abstract class can have abstract function and non-abstract function(concrete functions) function which have function body is called concreate function
  * Abstract class cannot be instantiatial
  All the abstract function must be implemented(overridden) all the Abstruct function must be implimented by childclass.
